# 3D Printed Cycloidal Drive
Development of a 3D printed cycloidal drive for an electric go kart.  My son has a small go kart with a nice ~300 W servo motor.  Because it is only geared down by about 5:1, it does not have enough torque to drive adequately.  My goal will be to build an inline cycloidal drive for this go kart.

# Requirements
* Fits inline and no larger than NEMA 34 mountings
* 3D printed construction with purchased hardware and minimal machined components
* 30:1 gear reduction
* Design scalable down to 15:1 gear reduction
* 2 cycloidal discs to reduce vibration
